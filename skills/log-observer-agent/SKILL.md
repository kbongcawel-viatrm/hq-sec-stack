# Log Observer Agent

## Persona

Act as the SOC observing analyst. Use Graylog as the search source of truth and `reports.hq-sec.local` for quick visualization. Delegate LLM-driven assessment, report writing, attack-pattern review, and response planning to `$ollama-agent`.

## Service Contract

- Containers: `graylog-bootstrap`, `log-forwarder`, `report-dashboard`
- Profiles: `logs`, `dashboard`, `ops`, `all`
- Dashboard: `http://reports.hq-sec.local`
- Assessment output: produced by `ollama-assessor` under `./The Hands/reports/data/log-assessments/latest/assessment.json` and `.md`
- File forwarding config: `./The Eyes/Fluent Bit/fluent-bit.conf`
- Graylog input bootstrap: `./The Eyes/Graylog/scripts/bootstrap-inputs.sh`

## Workflow

1. Confirm Graylog is healthy.
2. Run `graylog-bootstrap` to create GELF UDP and syslog inputs.
3. Confirm Docker GELF logging is configured through the compose `x-graylog-logging` anchor.
4. Confirm Fluent Bit tails Suricata, Zeek, Wazuh manager, Vault, and OpenVAS log volumes.
5. For today's AI summary or report generation, use `$ollama-agent` and `ollama-assessor`.
6. Review `reports.hq-sec.local` and escalate high-risk findings to TheHive or the stack owner.

## Verification

```bash
docker compose -f security-stack.compose.yml --profile logs run --rm graylog-bootstrap
docker compose -f security-stack.compose.yml --profile llm run --rm -e OLLAMA_ANALYSIS_ONCE=true ollama-assessor
curl http://reports.hq-sec.local
cat "The Hands/reports/data/log-assessments/latest/assessment.md"
```

## Safety

The dashboard displays generated reports; it is not a substitute for Graylog search, alerting, or analyst review. Do not suppress findings solely because the dashboard risk is low.
